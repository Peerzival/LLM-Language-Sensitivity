She stared at the dying boy, trying to figure out if there was any sign of this being a joke request, but the boy's eyes met hers with clear determination. \n\n``He's a murderer... '' \n\nJason responded,`` I know. I'm aware.'' \n\n``And you want to meet him? ''Stephanie asked. \n\n`` Yes, ma'am, I do,'' he answered. The boy began coughing. He covered his mouth with a white cloth, and when he removed the cloth after finishing coughing, Stephanie could see he'd spit up a small pool of blood. \n\nStephanie said, ``Superman is close by. If we call him, he can be here within a few minu -- - '' \n\n`` No thanks.'' \n\n``What about Batman? '' \n\n`` Nope.'' \n\n``Flash? Iron Man? Spider-Man? '' \n\n`` Not interested, ma'am,'' the boy said weakly. \n\n``Uh... You do know he's killed kids, too, right? You're not asking for a good guy. '' \n\n`` That's not my problem. He hasn't killed me. He's not responsible for my cancer.'' \n\n``... Okay... Let me see what I can do, ''she said. Stephanie grabbed her notes and swiftly exited the room. \n\nShe was met at the end of the hall by her boss Jeremiah Lincoln. He'd been running this`` Meet Your Heroes!'' organization for a solid decade at this point. Nothing should surprise him... Except this request clearly did. \n\n``He wants to meet who?! '' \n\nStephanie turned away and nodded. She felt uncomfortable making eye contact with Mr. Lincoln when he was visibly upset. He was normally a jovial, easy-going guy, so the rare occasions when he was angry or sad made Stephanie feel the same emotions he did. \n\n`` Is this kid out of his mind?'' Mr. Lincoln asked. \n\nStephanie showed Mr. Lincoln the boy's medical chart. \n\n``Stage 4, huh? ''Mr. Lincoln muttered. He handed the chart back to Stephanie. \n\n`` Yes, sir,'' she answered quietly. ``He doesn't have much time. '' \n\nMr. Lincoln paced a bit. After a few moments of silence between the two, Mr. Lincoln said,`` Okay, fine. Find out how we can contact The Joker.''",

Children loved to see their friend, because he brought joy and laughter to them. Mickey was a clean mouse right from the beginning. Perhaps this is one reason why people hate real mice and love Mickey Mouse. In his early life Mickey made some mistakes. People were angry. They wrote to Disney and said that they did not want Mickey to do silly things. So Disney made a new animal named Donald Duck. He also made a dog called Pluto. This dog does stupid things and makes mistakes wherever he goes. Now our Mickey Mouse is not only clean but also important. He appears as a beautiful and clever star.

Second, more offspring are produced than are able to survive; in other words, resources for survival and reproduction are limited. The capacity for reproduction in all organisms outstrips the availability of resources to support their numbers. Thus, there is a competition for those resources in each generation.

Third, offspring vary among each other in regard to their characteristics and those variations are inherited. Out of these three principles, Darwin and Wallace reasoned that offspring with inherited characteristics that allow them to best compete for limited resources will survive and have more offspring than those individuals with variations that are less able to compete. Because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better represented in the next generation.

                "reference_text": "Over 2500 years ago Aristotle proposed two laws of physics governing motion. One for \u2018Earthly bodies\u2019 (objects on Earth) that states objects naturally go in straight lines and one for \u2018Heavenly bodies\u2019 (objects in space) that states objects naturally go in circles. This idea held steady for 2,000 years until Isaac Newton, in a triumph of brilliance, declared that there is one law of physics that governs motion and he unified \u201cearthly\u201d bodies and \u201cheavenly\u201d bodies with the The Universal Law of Gravitation. Newton used the universal law of gravity to prove that the moon is accelerating towards Earth just as a body on Earth is falling towards it. The acceleration of both the moon and the object on Earth is calculated using the same formula. This theory is so well regarded that it has been used to hypothesize the existence of black holes and dark matter, later verified by observation. The search to unify the laws of physics into one theory continues today and is often referred to as the yet undiscovered Grand Unified Theory (GUT).",
