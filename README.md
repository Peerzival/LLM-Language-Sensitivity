# One Prompt to Rule them all 

This is a dataset created for the seminar **Selected Topics in Data Science** for the **Master's programme** at the **Georg-August University in GÃ¶ttingen**.

The goal is to investigate the effect of *changes in the language* (e.g. syntax,  wording or word structure) used in prompts on *model performance*.
